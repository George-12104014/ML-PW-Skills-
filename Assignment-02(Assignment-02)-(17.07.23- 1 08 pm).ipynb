    "\n",
    "1. Single-line comments: Single-line comments are used to add a comment on a single line. They are often used for short, concise explanations or to disable a line of code temporarily. In Python, single-line comments are denoted by the hash character (`#`). Anything after the `#` symbol on the same line is considered a comment. For example:\n",

In Python, multi-line comments are commonly referred to as docstrings, and they are often used to document functions, classes, or modules. Docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes (`\"\"\"` or `'''`).

    "In Python, variables are dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare their type explicitly. The type of a variable is determined based on the value assigned to it. Variables can store various types of data, including numbers (integers, floats), strings, lists, dictionaries, and more.\n",

    "In Python, you can convert one data type to another using type conversion functions or constructors. Here's a brief explanation of the commonly used type conversion methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implicit Type Conversion: Python automatically performs implicit type conversion in certain situations when it's safe to do so. For example, when performing arithmetic operations between compatible data types, Python automatically converts them as needed. For instance, adding an integer and a float results in a float:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 3.14\n",
    "result = a + b  # Implicit conversion of int to float\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 13.14\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explicit Type Conversion: Explicit type conversion, also known as type casting, is performed using specific functions or constructors. Here are some commonly used type conversion functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int()`: Converts a value to an integer data type. It can convert floats, strings representing integers, or even boolean values. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  num_float = 3.14\n",
    "  num_int = int(num_float)\n",
    "  print(num_int)  # Output: 3\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `float()`: Converts a value to a float data type. It can convert integers, strings representing numbers, or boolean values. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  num_int = 10\n",
    "  num_float = float(num_int)\n",
    "  print(num_float)  # Output: 10.0\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `str()`: Converts a value to a string data type. It can convert integers, floats, booleans, or any other data type to its string representation. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  num_int = 42\n",
    "  num_str = str(num_int)\n",
    "  print(num_str)  # Output: \"42\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `bool()`: Converts a value to a boolean data type. It can convert integers, floats, strings, or any other data type to their corresponding boolean values. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  num = 10\n",
    "  is_zero = bool(num)  # Non-zero values are considered True\n",
    "  print(is_zero)  # Output: True\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of type conversion functions in Python. There are additional functions available for more specific conversions, such as `list()`, `tuple()`, and `dict()`, depending on the desired target data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type conversion is useful when you need to perform operations that require compatible data types or when you want to ensure the data is in the expected format for further processing."

    "To write and execute a Python script from the command line, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a text editor and write your Python code. Save the file with a `.py` extension, which is the standard extension for Python scripts. For example, you can create a file called `my_script.py` and add your Python code in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To execute the script, use the `python` command followed by the name of your script file. For example, if your script is named `my_script.py`, you would run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python my_script.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command will run your Python script, and the output (if any) will be displayed in the terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the `python` command assumes that the Python interpreter is installed and added to the system's PATH environment variable. If you encounter any issues running the `python` command, ensure that Python is installed correctly and its location is added to the PATH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if you have multiple versions of Python installed on your system, you may need to specify the version explicitly by using `python3` instead of `python` in the command, depending on your setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Executing a Python script from the command line allows you to run your code and interact with it directly without the need for an integrated development environment (IDE). It's a simple and efficient way to execute Python scripts and see their results in the terminal."
