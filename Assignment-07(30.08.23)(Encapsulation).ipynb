    "**Abstraction** in object-oriented programming refers to the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on their essential properties and behaviors while ignoring irrelevant details.

    "**Abstraction** and **encapsulation** are both important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), but they address different aspects of designing and organizing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction:**\n",
    "- Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on their essential properties and behaviors while ignoring irrelevant details.\n",
    "- It focuses on creating a clear and high-level view of objects and their interactions, hiding unnecessary implementation details.\n",
    "- Abstraction is about defining interfaces that hide the complexities of the underlying systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation:**\n",
    "- Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (a class), thereby restricting direct access to some of its components.\n",
    "- It aims to protect the internal state of an object from unintended or unauthorized access and modification.\n",
    "- Encapsulation provides controlled access to an object's attributes and methods through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the difference between abstraction and encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self._mileage = 0  # Encapsulation with a protected attribute\n",

    "        print(f\"Car: {self.make} {self.model}, Mileage: {self._mileage}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- **Abstraction:** The `Car` class abstracts the concept of a car. It models a car's make, model, and mileage. Users of the class interact with high-level concepts such as driving the car and displaying its information. The class hides the implementation details of how mileage is stored and updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation:** The attribute `_mileage` is marked with a single underscore, indicating that it's meant to be a protected attribute. This means that it's not intended to be accessed directly from outside the class. Instead, users interact with the mileage through the `drive` and `get_mileage` methods, enforcing controlled access to the attribute. This encapsulates the internal state of the car while providing a well-defined interface for interacting with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, abstraction focuses on presenting a simplified and high-level view of objects, while encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is protected and accessed only through controlled interfaces. Both concepts contribute to writing modular, maintainable, and secure code in OOP."

    "The `abc` module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides a way to define abstract base classes, which are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own but are meant to be subclassed by other classes. Abstract base classes serve as templates or blueprints for other classes and ensure that certain methods are implemented by their subclasses.\n",

    "The `abc` module is used for several purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining Abstract Base Classes:** You can use the `abc` module to create abstract base classes by using the `ABC` metaclass. An abstract base class is a class that includes abstract methods, which are methods without an implementation. Subclasses of the abstract base class are required to provide implementations for these abstract methods.\n",

The `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes are subclasses of `Shape` and they provide concrete implementations for the `area()` method. The `abstractmethod` decorator from the `abc` module indicates that `area()` must be implemented by any subclass of `Shape`. This structure enforces a consistent interface for different shapes while allowing for specific implementations."

    "Data abstraction in object-oriented programming involves hiding the complex implementation details of data and exposing only the essential features and behaviors. This is achieved through the use of classes and encapsulation. Here's how you can achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a Class:**\n",
    "   Start by defining a class that represents the abstract concept you want to model. This class should include attributes (data) and methods (functions) that provide a clear and simplified interface for working with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Access Modifiers:**\n",
    "   Use access modifiers to control the visibility of attributes and methods. In languages like Python, you can use naming conventions such as a single underscore `_` (protected) or double underscores `__` (private) to indicate the level of visibility. This restricts direct access to internal details from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hide Implementation Details:**\n",
    "   Encapsulate the internal data and implementation details within the class. The external world should only interact with the class through the provided methods, ensuring that users of the class are shielded from unnecessary complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Provide Essential Methods:**\n",
    "   Design the methods of the class in a way that exposes the essential features of the data while abstracting away the internal mechanisms. These methods should provide a simple, consistent, and well-defined interface for interacting with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Enforce Validation and Logic:**\n",
    "   Use the class's methods to enforce data validation, logic, and constraints. By controlling data modifications through methods, you can ensure that the data remains consistent and valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Document the Interface:**\n",
    "   Document the class's public methods and their purposes. This documentation serves as a contract for how users should interact with the class and its data, emphasizing the abstraction and high-level view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified example in Python demonstrating data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "        self._account_number = account_number\n",
    "        self._balance = balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        self._balance += amount\n",

    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount <= self._balance:\n",
    "            self._balance -= amount\n",
    "        else:\n",
